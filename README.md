# OSdev

Here's my long enough attempt on building a x64 kernel with **Assembly** & **C**

## Building

This project is set up to be built inside a Docker container.
The operating system can be built by running `make` in the projects root directory
This project depends on several packages such as `gcc make nasm qemu`

## Running on Qemu
## Running on Baremetal
